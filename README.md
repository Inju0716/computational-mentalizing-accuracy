# computational-mentalizing-accuracy
This repository contains the Python code used for text vectorization and cosine similarity computation in the study, *Toward Computational Measurement of Mentalizing for Predicting Adaptive Social Behavior*. Text vectorization was performed using the Korean SBERT model ([KR-SBERT](https://github.com/snunlp/KR-SBERT)).
